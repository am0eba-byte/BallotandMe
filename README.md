# BallotandMe
Hello! This will be the repo our project team will use to create our Semester Project on Langston Hughes's typescript play **The Ballot and Me.**

Project team: Mia Borgia, Brett Meyer, McKenna Ballew

Research goals:
- xml:id all historical figure characters and keep track of their roles/speaking parts in the play. Make historical figures' xml:id reference their historical backgrounds

Possible research questions:
- Who/what is the "Sojourner Truth" supposed to represent?
- Is the dialogue from characters based on real historical figures quoted directly from speeches those historical figures have made?
