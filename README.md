# BallotandMe
Hello! This will be the repo I use to create my Semester Project on Langston Hughes's typescript play **The Ballot and Me.**

Possible research questions:
- Who/what is the "Sojourner Truth" supposed to represent?
- Is the dialogue from characters based on real historical figures quoted directly from speeches those historical figures have made?
