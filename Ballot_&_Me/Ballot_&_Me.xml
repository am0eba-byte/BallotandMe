THE BALLOT AND ME

SETTING: A rostrum
TIME: The present, with flashbacks
ACTION: A Narrator comes to the rostrum
and shouts four words very loudly 
as if opening a Town Meeting.

NARRATOR: Ballot! SUFFRAGE! Franchise! vote1

(NARRATOR BANGS HIS GAVEL)
The dichotomy says:
"Ballot --- the method of secret voting; originally by means of small balls placed in an urn or box."
"Suffrage --- a vote given by a member of a body, state, or society, in assent to a proposition or in favor of the election of a person."
"Franchise --- the right of voting at public elections."
"Vote --- an intimation that one approves, or disapproves, accepts or rejects, a proposal, motion, candidate for office, or the like."
NARRATOR (cont'd): The right to cast a ballot, to exercise 
suffrage, to vote is one of the basic 
rights to citizens in a democracy---a democracy that form of government in which control is 
vested in the people as a whole. The ballot is basic.
Negro Americans  ---you, me---are very much a part of this democracy. We're 15 million---
and our vote counts. From the national to the local level, your vote counts. It counts
in more and better jobs---in diplomatic posts
abroad to local political patronage. It
counts in education, in housing, in civil 
rights, in cleaner streets, in better garbage
colection. The vote has value. Don't neglect
your right to vote. Don't waste it.
Don't forget it.
Maybe all of us would value the right of 
suffrage more if we stopped to look back a 
moment at what the struggle for the vote has 
cost. Back in the Middle Age few people 
had control over their own lives, let alone
over the land or the country. Kins and 
barons and chiefs and over-lords ran everything
and everybody. Then came the Magna 
Carta in 1215 in England, and almost 400

NARRATOR (cont'd): years later the Bill of Rights, many of 
whose previsions were incoroprated into our own Consitution in 1787 and into the
American Bill of Rights in 1791. Some of those rights, we, the Negro people of America,
are still trying to secure in full.
We came to these shores first as explorers---
with Cortex, with Balboa, with Columbus. But we 
did not migrate in large numbers. The
majority of our ancestors were brought to the
Americas by force as slaves, dating from 1619.
Slaves, like serfs in Europe, could not vote.
But very early in our history, after the 
colonies won their freedom from the British---
Crispus Attucks of Boston, a Negro, being
the first man killed when resistance to the
British started---free Negroes in the New
England colonies voted. Some Negroes in our
country have always voted from the very beginning
of our United States, and fought
to keep the vote and extend it to others.
But sometimes it was a hard battle. You who
have the vote herre in New York, keep it, use
it, and help others to get it.
After the Revolutionary War, free Negroes
could vote anywhere, but in 1789 the Southern
slave-holding states sensed danger in letting
free Negroes vote, and begna to disfranchise
them. By 1834 no Negroes could vote in the

NARRATOR (cont'd): South, and some Northern states like 
Pennsylvania and Indiana denied them the ballot,
too. But colored men in New York, could
vote if they owned property and had lived
here for three years. This man could vote.

(SAMUEL FRAUNCES ENTERS IN COLONIAL KNICKERS)

Samuel Fraunces. He was the owner of the Frances
Tavern at Broad and Pearl Streets in New York
City. At his tavern George Washington often
dined, and when Washington became President,
he made Samuel Fraunces his chiel steward.

FRAUNCES: And I (could) vote(d).
NARRATOR: Fraunces was a man of means, a solid citizen, interested
in the affairs of the day. Free Negroes in New York
then could vote.

(SUDDENLY THE SPOTLIGHT FOCUSES ON A
BONNETED WONAM SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE
IN THE CORNER OF A PEW WHO QUICLY
SPEAKS UP LOUDLY. SHE IS SOJOURNER TRUTH)

SOJOURNER: Could I vote? I lived in New York.

NARRATOR: No, Sojourner Truth. You were a woman, and in those
days only men could vote.

SOJOURNER: Which were wrong! I believed everybody should vote,
black and white, man and women! And I said so./

NARRATOR: I know you said so. Yoou went to the first women's
suffrage meetings, and you joined with Abby Kelly
ad Lucretia Mott and Frances Gage, white women,
in speaking not only for Negro freedom, but for
the freedom of women. You were a runwawy slave
who made your self free.

SOJOURNER: And I wanted to vote.
