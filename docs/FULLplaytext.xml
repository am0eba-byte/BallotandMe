                <p><lb/>The right to cast a ballot, to exercise 
                    <lb/>suffrage, to vote is one of the basic
                    <lb/>rights of citizens in a democracy --- a democracy,
                    <lb/>that form of government in which control is
                    <lb/>vested in the people as a whole. The ballot
                    <lb/>is basic.</p>
                <p><lb/>Negro Americans---you, me--- are very much a
                    <lb/>part of this democracy. We're 15 million---
                    <lb/>and our vote counts. From the national to
                    <lb/>the local level, <underline>your</underline> vote counts. It counts
                    <lb/>in more and better jobs---in diplomatic posts
                    <lb/>abroad to local political patronage. It
                    <lb/>counts in education, in housing, in civil
                    <lb/>rights, in cleaner streets, in better garbage
                    <lb/>collection. The vote has value. Don't ne-
                    <lb/>glect your right to vote. Don't waste it.
                    <lb/>Dont forget it.</p>
                <p><lb/>Maybe all of us would value the right of
                    <lb/>suffrage more if we stopped to look back a
                    <lb/>moment at what the struggle for the vote has
                    <lb/>cost. Back in the Middle Ages few people
                    <lb/>had control over their own lives, let alone
                    <lb/>over the land or the country. Kings and
                    <lb/>barons and chiefs and over-lords ran every-
                    <lb/>thing and everybody. Then came the Magna

                    <lb/>whose provisions were incorporated into
                    <lb/>our own Constitution in <date when="1787">1787</date> and into the
                    <lb/>American Bill of Rights in <date when="1791">1791</date>. Some of
                    <lb/>those rights, we, the Negro people of America,
                    <lb/>are still trying to secure in full.</p>
                <p><lb/>We came to these shores first as explorers---
                    <lb/>with Cortez, with Balboa, with Columbus. But
                    <lb/>we did not migrate in large numbers. The
                    <lb/>majority of our ancestors were brought to the
                    <lb/>Americas by force as slaves, dating back from <date when="1619">1619</date>.
                    <lb/>Slaves, like serfs in <location>Europe</location>, could not vote.
                    <lb/>But very early in our history, after the
                    <lb/>colonies won their freedom from the British---
                    <lb/>Crispus Attucks of <location>Boston</location>, a Negro, being
                    <lb/>the first man killed when resistence to the
                    <lb/>British started---free Negros in the New
                    <lb/>England colonies voted. Some Negros in our
                    <lb/>country have always voted from the very be-
                    <lb/>ginning of our United States, and fought
                    <lb/>to keep the vote and extend it to others.
                    <lb/>But sometimes it was a hard battle. You who
                    <lb/>have the vote here in New York, keep it, use
                    <lb/>it, and help others to get it.
                </p>
                <p><lb/>After the Revolutionary War, free Negros
                    <lb/>could vote anywhere, but in <date when="1789">1789</date> the Southern
                    <lb/>slave-holding states sensed danger in letting
                    <lb/>free Negroes vote, and began to disfranchise
                    <lb/>them. By <date when="1834">1834</date> no Negroes could vote in the

                    <lb/>During the Reconstruction in lesser degrees thereafter,
                    <lb/>many Negroes were active in state governments. For example, between <date when="1868">1868</date> and
                    <lb/><date when="1896">1896</date> <location>Louisiana</location> elected 32 state senators of color and 95 representatives.
                    <lb/>P. B. S. Pinchback was lieutenant-Governor and, in <date when="1873">1873</date>, after the removal of
                    <lb/>the white incumbent, Pinchback became Acting-Governor of Louisiana. In <location>Florida</location>,
                    <lb/>Jonathan Gibbs, a Dartmouth graduate, became Secretary of State. And in South
                    <lb/>Carolina, the London-educated Francis L. Cardoso was from <date when="1872">1872</date> to <date when="1876">1876</date> the
                    <lb/>State Treasurer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <lb/>But when federal troops were removed from the South in <date when="1877">1877</date> and
                    <lb/>Negro voters no longer had protection at the polls, reaction set in. The Ku Klux
                    <lb/>Klan began to ride. Voters werre intimidated, tarred and feathered, whipped,
                    <lb/>shot down. Black Codes were passed denying civil rights, and some states originated
                    <lb/>Grandfather Clauses which said that unless you or your parents had voted before the
                    <lb/>Civil War, you could not vote now --- which meant freedom were not eligible. Negro
                    <lb/>political power faded in the South. For a brief period during the rise of the
                    <lb/>Populist Party of farmers and poor whites, both Democrats and Reublicans again
                    <lb/>sought the Negro vote to keep The Populists from becoming powerful. then, from <date when="1883">1883</date> to
