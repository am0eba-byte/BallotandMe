            <p>The right to cast a ballot, to exercise 
               suffrage, to vote is one of the basic
               rights of citizens in a democracy --- a democracy,
               that form of government in which control is
               vested in the people as a whole. The ballot
               is basic.Negro Americans---you, me--- are very much a
               part of this democracy. We're 15 million---
               and our vote counts. From the national to
               the local level, your vote counts. It counts
               in more and better jobs---in diplomatic posts
               abroad to local political patronage. It
               counts in education, in housing, in civil
               rights, in cleaner streets, in better garbage
               collection. The vote has value. Don't ne-
               glect your right to vote. Don't waste it.
               Dont forget it.Maybe all of us would value the right of
               suffrage more if we stopped to look back a
               moment at what the struggle for the vote has
               cost. Back in the Middle Ages few people
               had control over their own lives, let alone
               over the land or the country. Kings and
               barons and chiefs and over-lords ran every-
               thing and everybody. Then came the Magna
               Carta in 1315 in England, and almost 400</p>

               whose provisions were incorporated into
               our own Constitution in 1787 and into the
               American Bill of Rights in 1791. Some of
               those rights, we, the Negro people of America,
               are still trying to secure in full.We came to these shores first as explorers---
               with Cortez, with Balboa, with Columbus. But
               we did not migrate in large numbers. The
               majority of our ancestors were brought to the
               Americas by force as slaves, dating back from 1619.
               Slaves, like serfs in Europe, could not vote.
               But very early in our history, after the
               colonies won their freedom from the British---
               Crispus Attucks of Boston, a Negro, being
               the first man killed when resistence to the
               British started---free Negros in the New
               England colonies voted. Some Negros in our
               country have always voted from the very be-
               ginning of our United States, and fought
               to keep the vote and extend it to others.
               But sometimes it was a hard battle. You who
               have the vote here in New York, keep it, use
               it, and help others to get it.
               After the Revolutionary War, free Negros
               could vote anywhere, but in 1789 the Southern
               slave-holding states sensed danger in letting
               free Negroes vote, and began to disfranchise
               them. By 1834 no Negroes could vote in the

               the South into five military districts, proclaimed

               at the polls to protect the Negro's newly granted
               right to vote. This right was made permanent by
               the passage in 1870 of the 15th Amendment to the
               Constitution of the United States. 700,000 Negroes
               were added to the voting rolls of the South, and
               many city and state offices were filled by the

               sent 14 Negro Representatives and 2 Senators of
               color to Washington. The first Representative
               was from Georgia, elected in 1869, Jefferson P.

               During the Reconstruction in lesser degrees thereafter,
               many Negroes were active in state governments. For example, between 1868 and
               1896 Louisiana elected 32 state senators of color and 95 representatives.
               P. B. S. Pinchback was lieutenant-Governor and, in 1873, after the removal of
               the white incumbent, Pinchback became Acting-Governor of Louisiana. In Florida,
               Jonathan Gibbs, a Dartmouth graduate, became Secretary of State. And in South
               Carolina, the London-educated Francis L. Cardoso was from 1872 to 1876 the
               State Treasurer.
               
               But when federal troops were removed from the South in 1877 and
               Negro voters no longer had protection at the polls, reaction set in. The Ku Klux
               Klan began to ride. Voters werre intimidated, tarred and feathered, whipped,
               shot down. Black Codes were passed denying civil rights, and some states originated
               Grandfather Clauses which said that unless you or your parents had voted before the
               Civil War, you could not vote now --- which meant freedom were not eligible. Negro
               political power faded in the South. For a brief period during the rise of the
               Populist Party of farmers and poor whites, both Democrats and Reublicans again
               sought the Negro vote to keep The Populists from becoming powerful. then, from 1883 to
               1897, six Negroes were elected as Representatives to Washington. They were:
               from Virginia, John M. Langstonfrom South Carolina, Thomas E. Miller and George W. Murray:And from North Carolina, James E. O'Hara, Henry P. Cheatham:
               And the last of the Southern Representatives, George H. White of
               North Carolina, elected in 1897.

               When White completed his term in 1901, it was 27 years before
               another Negro went to Congress.
               One of the outstanding colored politicians was John M. Langston,
               Congressman from Virginia, founder of the Law School at Howard
               Univerity, and first presidnet of Virginia State College for

               deny the rights to vote, or failed to count, the ballots of Negro
               citizens at the turn of the century. When Charles H. White left
               Congress in 1901, it was more than a quarter of a century before we
               had there another national representative. In 1928 Oscar DePriest
               was elected to Congress from the First Illinois District -- being
               the first Northern Negro over to sit in the national legislature. 
               As the great migrations from the South increased after each war,
               and the black populations of our Northern industrial cities grew,
               so Negro political power grew. Manicipal judges, city councilmen,
               county officials,  and state legislators of color from New York to
               Los Angeles became not uncommon. From Illinois, Arthur W. Michell

               serving now. From New York Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. was elected
               in 1945, and most recentlyCharles CDiggs of Detroit became the 27th man
               of color to sit in Congresss. There should be more -- more
