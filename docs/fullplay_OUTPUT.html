                  <br />in favor of the election of a person."

                  <br />"<u>Vote</u>--- an intimation that one approves or disapproves,

               <p><br />The right to cast a ballot, to exercise 
                  <br />suffrage, to vote is one of the basic
                  <br />rights of citizens in a democracy --- a democracy,
                  <br />that form of government in which control is
                  <br />vested in the people as a whole. The ballot
                  <br />is basic.</p>
               
               <p><br />Negro Americans---you, me--- are very much a
                  <br />part of this democracy. We're 15 million---
                  <br />and our vote counts. From the national to
                  <br />the local level, <u>your</u> vote counts. It counts
                  <br />in more and better jobs---in diplomatic posts
                  <br />abroad to local political patronage. It
                  <br />counts in education, in housing, in civil
                  <br />rights, in cleaner streets, in better garbage
                  <br />collection. The vote has value. Don't ne-
                  <br />glect your right to vote. Don't waste it.
                  <br />Dont forget it.</p>
               
               <p><br />Maybe all of us would value the right of
                  <br />suffrage more if we stopped to look back a
                  <br />moment at what the struggle for the vote has
                  <br />cost. Back in the Middle Ages few people
                  <br />had control over their own lives, let alone
                  <br />over the land or the country. Kings and
                  <br />barons and chiefs and over-lords ran every-
                  <br />thing and everybody. Then came the Magna
                  <br />Carta in <span class="date">1315</span> in <span class="location">England</span>, and almost 400</p>

               <p><br />years later the Bill of Rights, many of 
                  <br />whose provisions were incorporated into
                  <br />our own Constitution in <span class="date">1787</span> and into the
                  <br />American Bill of Rights in <span class="date">1791</span>. Some of
                  <br />those rights, we, the Negro people of America,
                  <br />are still trying to secure in full.</p>
               
               <p><br />We came to these shores first as explorers---
                  <br />with Cortez, with Balboa, with Columbus. But
                  <br />we did not migrate in large numbers. The
                  <br />majority of our ancestors were brought to the
                  <br />Americas by force as slaves, dating back from <span class="date">1619</span>.
                  <br />Slaves, like serfs in <span class="location">Europe</span>, could not vote.
                  <br />But very early in our history, after the
                  <br />colonies won their freedom from the British---
                  <br />Crispus Attucks of <span class="location">Boston</span>, a Negro, being
                  <br />the first man killed when resistence to the
                  <br />British started---free Negros in the New
                  <br />England colonies voted. Some Negros in our
                  <br />country have always voted from the very be-
                  <br />ginning of our United States, and fought
                  <br />to keep the vote and extend it to others.
                  <br />But sometimes it was a hard battle. You who
                  <br />have the vote here in New York, keep it, use
                  <br />it, and help others to get it.
                  </p>
               
               <p><br />After the Revolutionary War, free Negros
                  <br />could vote anywhere, but in <span class="date">1789</span> the Southern
                  <br />slave-holding states sensed danger in letting
                  <br />free Negroes vote, and began to disfranchise
                  <br />them. By <span class="date">1834</span> no Negroes could vote in the

                  <br />During the Reconstruction in lesser degrees thereafter,
                  <br />many Negroes were active in state governments. For example, between <span class="date">1868</span> and
                  <br /><span class="date">1896</span> <span class="location">Louisiana</span> elected 32 state senators of color and 95 representatives.
                  <br />P. B. S. Pinchback was lieutenant-Governor and, in <span class="date">1873</span>, after the removal of
                  <br />the white incumbent, Pinchback became Acting-Governor of Louisiana. In <span class="location">Florida</span>,
                  <br />Jonathan Gibbs, a Dartmouth graduate, became Secretary of State. And in South
                  <br />Carolina, the London-educated Francis L. Cardoso was from <span class="date">1872</span> to <span class="date">1876</span> the
                  <br />State Treasurer.
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <br />But when federal troops were removed from the South in <span class="date">1877</span> and
                  <br />Negro voters no longer had protection at the polls, reaction set in. The Ku Klux
                  <br />Klan began to ride. Voters werre intimidated, tarred and feathered, whipped,
                  <br />shot down. Black Codes were passed denying civil rights, and some states originated
                  <br />Grandfather Clauses which said that unless you or your parents had voted before the
                  <br />Civil War, you could not vote now --- which meant freedom were not eligible. Negro
                  <br />political power faded in the South. For a brief period during the rise of the
                  <br />Populist Party of farmers and poor whites, both Democrats and Reublicans again
                  <br />sought the Negro vote to keep The Populists from becoming powerful. then, from <span class="date">1883</span> to
