               voter to consider well and wisely what vote to cast, wht party to bring to power and
               support in power, was so imperative. In discharging our duty in this regard, while
               we are fearless, we should be impartial and just. Let us not make haste to condemn
               unduly, nor to accept without wise discrimi- nation the claim of any candidate or
               party. We are called upon as intelligent and earnest, patriotic and devoted citizens,
               to determine, each for himself, how votes given for the Democratic or Republican party,
               will tend to sustain the dignity and power of the Government, and conserve our free
               institutions under the Constitution. Each of us is held responsible to his own conscience,
               posterity and God for the wisdom, or folly displayed in exercising our suffrage ---
               the most sacred, as it is the most valuable right which we possess on American soil.<span class="wordCount">Word count: 165</span></td>

               in the South. There is no defense or security for any of us except in the highest
               intelligence and development of all. Education must be digested and assimilated in
               order to make it significant. The science, the art, the literature that fails to reach
               down and bring the humblest up to the enjoyment of the fullest blessings of our government
               is weak, no matter how costly the buildings or apparatus used, or how modern the methods
               of instruction employed. The study of arithmetic that does not result in making men
               conscientious in receiving and counting the ballots of their fellow men is faulty.<span class="wordCount">Word count: 144</span></td>
