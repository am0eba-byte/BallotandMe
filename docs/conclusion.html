        <p class="conclusion">
            Our team chose to do our text-encoding project on "The Ballot and Me" by Langston Hughes 
            due to the resounding relevance of its message, especially in this year's 2020 elections. 
            As we coded this play, we began to make connections in our markup and use our code
            to highlight important aspects of each character's part in the play, and how they correspond
            to the importance of each historical characters' roles in real life. As we coded Hughes' work,
            and in doing so became more intimately familiar with this script, it became unquestionably
            clear how important the Hughes's message remains - especially to minority groups in 
            society today. People of color (POC) had to fight for their rights back in the 1800's 
            because the southern slave-holding states sensed danger in letting POC vote. As 
            of today (2020), Voter ID laws have underlying racial biases which prevent 
            minorities from enganing in active participation. With the 2020 election, active 
            participation was encouraged to lift the restrictions against minority populations.
            Organizations and indivduals are bringing cases of voter descrimination to court 
            in an attempt to resolve these wrongdoings. In this project, we aimed to highlight 
            the prominent voices in African American history and politics, and show that there
            remains a lot of work to be done to combat racial discrimination - and, using our code,
            underline the emphasis in Hughes's cries to the audience to exercise and defend their 
            rights to vote.</p>

        <p class="conclusion">As we coded the play, we made note of the connections to the 
            prominence of each historical characters' stage presence; the characters who had
            large speaking parts typically had more prominent roles in civil rights and voting
            equality in real life. As such, we developed the data on our Analysis page using our mindful
            xml:id coding of each character's speaking parts and narrator references, so that we could
            provide viewers with a more observable look into the play and the characters in it within
            our data table. We thought that it might help bring more life to the characters and their historical
            importance &amp; relevance to African American voting rights if we created this table, which shows
            their real faces alongside the statements made by them or about them in the play.

        <p class="imageSources">The images we used in the data table on the Analysis page came from each character's Wikipedia page. (Thanks, Wikipedia!)</p>
