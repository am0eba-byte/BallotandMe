            <p class="conclusion"> Our team chose to do our text-encoding project on "The Ballot and
                Me" by Langston Hughes due to the resounding relevance of its message, especially in
                this year's 2020 elections. As we coded this play, we began to make connections in
                our markup and use our code to highlight important aspects of each character's part
                in the play, and how they correspond to the importance of each historical
                characters' roles in real life. As we coded Hughes' work, and in doing so became
                more intimately familiar with this script, it became unquestionably clear how
                important the Hughes's message remains - especially to minority groups in society
                today. People of color (POC) had to fight for their rights back in the 1800's
                because the southern slave-holding states sensed danger in letting POC vote. As of
                today (2020), Voter ID laws have underlying racial biases which prevent minorities
                from enganing in active participation. With the 2020 election, active participation
                was encouraged to lift the restrictions against minority populations. Organizations
                and indivduals are bringing cases of voter descrimination to court in an attempt to
                resolve these wrongdoings. In this project, we aimed to highlight the prominent
                voices in African American history and politics, and show that there remains a lot
                of work to be done to combat racial discrimination - and, using our code, underline
                the emphasis in Hughes's cries to the audience to exercise and defend their rights
                to vote.</p>

                <figcaption><p><i>This image shows POC protesting against the voting restrictions

        <p class="conclusion">As we coded the play, we made note of the connections to the
            prominence of each historical characters' stage presence; the characters who had large
            speaking parts typically had more prominent roles in civil rights and voting equality in
            real life. As such, we developed the data on our Analysis page using our mindful xml:id
            coding of each character's speaking parts and narrator references, so that we could
            provide viewers with a more observable look into the play and the characters in it
            within our data table. We thought that it might help bring more life to the characters
            and their historical importance &amp; relevance to African American voting rights if we
            created this table, which shows their real faces alongside the statements made by them
            or about them in the play. </p>
