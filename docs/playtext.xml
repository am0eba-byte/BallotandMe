                <p><lb/>The right to cast a ballot, to exercise 
                    <lb/>suffrage, to vote is one of the basic
                    <lb/>rights of citizens in a democracy --- a democracy,
                    <lb/>that form of government in which control is
                    <lb/>vested in the people as a whole. The ballot
                    <lb/>is basic.</p>
                <p><lb/>Negro Americans---you, me--- are very much a
                    <lb/>part of this democracy. We're 15 million---
                    <lb/>and our vote counts. From the national to
                    <lb/>the local level, <underline>your</underline> vote counts. It counts
                    <lb/>in more and better jobs---in diplomatic posts
                    <lb/>abroad to local political patronage. It
                    <lb/>counts in education, in housing, in civil
                    <lb/>rights, in cleaner streets, in better garbage
                    <lb/>collection. The vote has value. Don't ne-
                    <lb/>glect your right to vote. Don't waste it.
                    <lb/>Dont forget it.</p>
                <p><lb/>Maybe all of us would value the right of
                    <lb/>suffrage more if we stopped to look back a
                    <lb/>moment at what the struggle for the vote has
                    <lb/>cost. Back in the Middle Ages few people
                    <lb/>had control over their own lives, let alone
                    <lb/>over the land or the country. Kings and
                    <lb/>barons and chiefs and over-lords ran every-
                    <lb/>thing and everybody. Then came the Magna

                    <lb/>whose provisions were incorporated into
                    <lb/>our own Constitution in 1787 and into the
                    <lb/>American Bill of Rights in 1791. Some of
                    <lb/>those rights, we, the Negro people of America,
                    <lb/>are still trying to secure in full.</p>
                <p><lb/>We came to these shores first as explorers---
                    <lb/>with Cortez, with Balboa, with Columbus. But
                    <lb/>we did not migrate in large numbers. The
                    <lb/>majority of our ancestors were brought to the
                    <lb/>Americas by force as slaves, dating back from 1619.
                    <lb/>Slaves, like serfs in Europe, could not vote.
                    <lb/>But very early in our history, after the
                    <lb/>colonies won their freedom from the British---
                    <lb/>Crispus Attucks of Boston, a Negro, being
                    <lb/>the first man killed when resistence to the
                    <lb/>British started---free Negros in the New
                    <lb/>England colonies voted. Some Negros in our
                    <lb/>country have always voted from the very be-
                    <lb/>ginning of our United States, and fought
                    <lb/>to keep the vote and extend it to others.
                    <lb/>But sometimes it was a hard battle. You who
                    <lb/>have the vote here in New York, keep it, use
                    <lb/>it, and help others to get it.
                </p>
                <p><lb/>After the Revolutionary War, free Negros
                    <lb/>could vote anywhere, but in 1789 the Southern
                    <lb/>slave-holding states sensed danger in letting
                    <lb/>free Negroes vote, and began to disfranchise
                    <lb/>them. By 1834 no Negroes could vote in the
